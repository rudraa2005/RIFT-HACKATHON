"""
Hybrid Scorer — Combines Rule-Based and ML Risk Scores.

Blends the existing rule-based suspicion score with the XGBoost ML
probability score using configurable weights:

    final_risk_score = rule_weight × normalized_rule_score + ml_weight × ml_risk_score

The rule score is normalized from [0, 100] → [0, 1] before blending.
If the ML model is unavailable or fails, falls back to the pure
normalized rule score.
